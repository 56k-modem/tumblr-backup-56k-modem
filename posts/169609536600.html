<p>HP 110 was a very first battery-powered MS-DOS portable and it was introduced in 1984. Programs were stored in ROM (including Lotus 1-2-3 and a terminal emulator) and user data in RAM (272 kB). A battery-powered floppy was available as an option as well as many other HP-IL devices that could be easily connected to the computer.</p>
<p>The machine was very popular among HP on-site support technicians as a portable terminal for access to large racked enterprise computers.<br/></p>
