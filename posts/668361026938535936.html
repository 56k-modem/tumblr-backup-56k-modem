<blockquote><p>Behold, a return to form. Introducing the <i>Halve Life</i> series, something I’ve been cooking up for the past half year. I aimed to achieve the same expectations of “<a href="https://youtu.be/VOqk8w6iNZo" target="_blank">A Posing Farce</a>“ and managed to shatter the ceiling, in my personal opinion. <br/></p><p>But the real personal achievement is how I’ve finally evolved into tweaking GoldSource maps, specifically entities, which has really opened up the world of possibilities (as well as my imagination). By using a simple tool called <a href="https://gamebanana.com/tools/5061" target="_blank">BSPEdit</a>, I’ve been able to implement NPCs, sequences, animations, and dialogues through what’s essentially a TXT format. I couldn’t have done it without the help of <a href="https://twhl.info/wiki/page/category%3AEntity_Guides" target="_blank"><i>The Whole Half-Life</i>’s very-useful entity guides</a>, so <i>huge</i> thanks to those authors! Now, I’m able to parodize Half-Life 1 potentially better than ever and make my <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9E1303BF55A17B2A" target="_blank"><i>Half-Serious</i></a> videos look like child’s play. 

<br/></p><p>On the topic of audio, editing/mixing for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/" target="_blank">Half-Life</a> is a piece of work. For example, since the engine only supports 8-bit/11025-Hz sounds in-game, I have to
 insert 16-bit vocals in editing (for the sake of quality), which requires video-capturing a recorded demo at least twice to isolate and replace the vocals (by manually muting files). Basically, audio will take the majority of my time with this series, even with my amateur mixing skills, but the end quality makes it worthwhile. <br/></p><p>Since this first part took about six months on/off to write and fully materialize, I imagine the next part will take at least as long as well. This is a video series that I see myself being thorough with since it could very well be my last parodic playthrough of the OG Half-Life. I hope you enjoy it!<br/></p></blockquote>
