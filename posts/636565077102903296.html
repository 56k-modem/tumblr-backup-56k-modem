booting from PCMCIA</h2><p>I recently mentioned
PCMCIA linear memory cards (both SRAM and flash) that existed before PCMCIA
controllers started to support IO devices and ATA. I used such an SRAM card in
my Olivetti Quaderno subnotebook instead of its failed hard drive. Quaderno
boots DOS from the internal ROM, loads a driver to support SRAM and allows using
it as an additional drive. However, there were also laptops that supported
booting from PCMCIA cards, and I am surprised that this feature was not
uncommon.</p><p>Certain
386/486 laptops with Phoenix BIOS have “PCMCIA” in the boot device list
(in addition to “hard drive” and “floppy drive”). These support just linear
flash/SRAM cards and let you boot DOS out of the card mapped as A:. Everything
works just fine and you don’t need to load any PCMCIA driver. ATA PCMCIA and
CompactFlash drives are not supported here – they are ignored by the BIOS
module.</p><p>The laptop
with AMI BIOS could have an optional “PCMCIA Boot Function” module. Once it was enabled and a card was inserted, the system booted from PCMCIA and mapped the card
again as A:. However, the support was flaky – just good enough to load a proper
PCMCIA driver during OS boot.</p><p>Laptops
from large brands (like Toshiba) mostly didn’t support this feature. ThinkPads were
an exception (486 and maybe also early Pentium ones). According to some owners,
they even supported booting from ATA/CF cards. However, ThinkPads as well as the
laptops with Phoenix and AMI software did not provide a driver-less access to
PCMCIA cards if a user booted from a different device. It seems that there is
only one known laptop that supported this – <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=70938" target="_blank">MiTAC 4022</a>. </p></blockquote>
