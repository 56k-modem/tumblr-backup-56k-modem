<p>downloading a 442-piece photoset from flickr uploaded by one of the guys who took photos with his DSLR during our trip</p>

<p>the set is not allowed to be downloaded in one for some reason</p>

<p>still downloading it in one</p>

<p>silly app gives random, fixed length numeric names for the files as it downloads them (presumably that&rsquo;s the images&rsquo; ID on flickr or something)</p>

<p>renaming all 442 files in one click with IrfanView&rsquo;s aptly named batch rename tool by using $E270 as name pattern, which is the EXIF data called ImageDescription, which happens to be the original file name of the images</p>

<p>figuring this out all by myself</p>
