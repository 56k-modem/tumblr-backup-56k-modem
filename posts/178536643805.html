<p>To explain it short and sweet, this project arrives just barely over a year after playing around and experimenting in <i>Half-Life </i>one day, around the time I was being heavily inspired by cLOUDDEAD’s abstract, self-titled album. I noticed how many solid black, key-able holes that were in a lot of the maps and discovered the opportunity to create a scrolling effect by using a consistent speed in each scene.</p>
<p>Gradually, over the year, I figured out how I wanted to stitch the scenes together and, in the process, learned more about keying and masking in Adobe After Effects, which I spent most of the project’s development time doing.<br/></p>
<p>Although I wish there were more scenes I was able to utilize in <i>Half-Life</i> for this project, I’m (overall) very satisfied with the outcome.<br/></p>
