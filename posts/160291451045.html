<p><b>Toshiba Libretto 20</b></p>
<p>CPU: AMD 486 DX4 75 MHz<br/>RAM: 8 to 20 MB<br/>HDD: 270 MB<br/>Display: 6.1&quot; TFT<br/>Weight: 840g<br/>Release: April 17 1996</p>
<p>The Libretto is a line of subnotebook computers designed and produced by Toshiba. The line was distinguished by its combination of functionality and small size, squeezing a full Windows PC into a device the size of a paperback book. The first Libretto model, the Libretto 20, was released on April 17, 1996 (in Japan only), with a volume of 821 cm3 and weighing just 840 g, making it by far, the world’s smallest commercially available Windows PC at the time, and a trend the Libretto Range continued for many years. The original Libretto line was discontinued in Europe and the U.S. in 1999, but the production continued in Japan with the SS, FF and then the L series until 2002.</p>
<p>Beginning with the Libretto 50, Toshiba used the Intel Pentium and later Pentium MMX processors. With the introduction of the L series in 2001, a move was made to the Transmeta Crusoe processor. The U100 of 2005 saw a return to Intel with the use of the Pentium M processor.</p>
