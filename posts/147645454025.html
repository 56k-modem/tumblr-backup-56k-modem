<h2>The Half-Life community has problems, but it’s not what you think.</h2>

<p>Fuckyeahhalf-life mod here. This is something I’ve been wanting to address for about a year now, but it is a messy subject. Then the opportunity arose last night when I posted about <a href="http://xen-dance.tumblr.com/post/147615841342/to-make-up-for-that-long-ass-post-cat-life-mod" target="_blank">the Cat-Life mod</a>.</p>
<p>For context, I sometimes post about old mod stuff. These were products of the community from way before there was a tumblr. From before there was a moddb. Before Steam. Cat-Life started development in <i>2002</i>. So yes, they can be cheesy and weird but they are wonderful. Whenever I post an old-ass goldsrc model or mod, I do it hoping you guys (who I understand are younger than me) will appreciate it the way we older folks do. These mods are products of love from a time before the Internet got really cynical and poisonous. They are <i>genuine.</i></p>
<p>So I noticed that when I post about this sort of content, this is the kind of response it gets:</p>
<figure data-orig-width="144" data-orig-height="21"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_oak70zgE561r5rz70_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="144" data-orig-height="21"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="491" data-orig-height="36" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_oak70phNVU1r5rz70_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="491" data-orig-height="36"/></figure><p><b>You guys got it backwards.</b> This is what is left in the Half-Life community that is worth sticking around for. Because it does have problems, serious ones. You don’t hear much about it here on tumblr (thank goodness), but there is a huge amount of fighting between veteran members. Some have been around since before the release of Half-Life 1. 

Think of them as fandom vips,

except with actual power to influence the community at large, and yes, maybe even Valve’s decisions. The general attitude in the core of the Half-Life community is extremely elitist and exclusionary. I’m not talking about social justice here, I mean if you are not part of the clique then expect your work to be sabotaged through rumour-spreading and just general petty Mean Girls type of shit. Positive contributions to the community are often run into the dirt so these people can keep their “power”. I really wish I could give examples, but I don’t want to name names, even though it’s obvious what I’m talking about to those who have been here for a while. My point is: We can assume that Valve has abandoned us and the core of the community is extremely poisonous. <b>The last thing we should be doing is punishing genuinity.</b></p>

<p>Thanks for posting this. I’ve been a fan since 1998 and I love old Half-Life stuff, GoldSrc and old maps/models/mods created with it. Sorry to hear about the toxicity of the community.</p><p>To the people not named in fuckyeahhalf-life’s post: Please stop being cunts.<br/></p>
