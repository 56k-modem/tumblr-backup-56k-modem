<blockquote><h2>Iomega ZIP
100 drives</h2><p>Thanks to
friends of mine, I was able to get two working parallel-port ZIP drives from Iomega.
My father used to use these during the 1990s as ZIP disks were popular in
offices in Czech Republic. He later switched to an internal ZIP drive connected
to IDE when his parallel-port external one died and used it for another 10
years.</p><p>I have a
few systems where it is not possible to add a network controller so I though
that this would be a good device for faster data transfers (compared to a
null-modem cable or diskettes) or accessing data larger than the internal hard
drives.</p><p>

It works just fine. The only drawback is that
you usually need a 486 system to leverage full speed of the external drive. My
386 laptops do not support the ECP/EPP protocols on the parallel port, so the access
speed is significantly limited (150KB/s?). Anyway, it is still convenient
enough for running DOS programs straight from the external drive. I am
surprised how nice driver support Iomega provided for DOS and Windows 9x. There
is even a “guest” driver in a form of a single exe file – just run it and you
can immediately access the drive using a newly assigned drive letter.</p><p>
