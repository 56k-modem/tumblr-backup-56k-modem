<h2>Digital DECpc
325SLC (1993)</h2>
<p>Digital (DEC)
always made interesting computers and their PC laptops were no exception. DECpc
325SLC was a laptop with the first generation of color passive-matrix displays.
The picture quality (aside the ability to display colors) was on par with monochrome
passive-matrix screens with all the drawbacks they had. On the other side, the
computer was equipped with a 25-MHz Intel 386SL and SVGA graphics for just
$2.100 – the price where other laptops from most other brands have just
monochrome screens and VGA graphics.</p>
<p>The 386SL is
the first CPU specifically designed by Intel for use in laptops. It integrates almost
a whole PC into two chips, with the main chip containing (among other things) a
386SX core (with 16-bit data bus) and 64kB of cache (16-bit as well). Intel
built the platform to support then new power management functions like the sleep
mode (“suspend to RAM”). The performance of this CPU is halfway between 386SX
and 386DX.</p>
<p>Graphics
chip was not integrated in the two Intel chips. Digital decided to use a chip
from Western Digital with 512kB of video memory and the support for 256 colors with
a resolution up to 800x600. The chip was attached using the ISA bus and had no
acceleration. On the other side, the support for
VESA VBE 1.2 

and ~3MB/s 
throughput 



to video memory made it a good mainstream solution among ISA based cards of the
time.</p>
<p>There was
also a detachable trackball module available for the computer. It’s not hot-plug
and you need to reboot the system, but it works surprisingly well even after
decades. Note the mouse icons on the arrow keys and Z/X – these are for the
mouse emulation. The laptop with no trackball or mouse attached transparently emulates
PS/2 mouse on these keys and the result is way more usable than the Windows
feature called “MouseKeys”.</p>
